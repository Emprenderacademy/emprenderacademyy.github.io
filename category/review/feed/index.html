<p>Most portable air conditioners have tradeoffs, the most common being sacrificing energy efficiency for better cooling performance. This isn&#8217;t the case with the Frigidaire Gallery FGPC1244T1. It is a balanced portable air conditioner with three fan speeds that is not only powerful at cooling, but also energy-efficient and feature-rich with a sleek design. An excellent five-year compressor warranty helps make this an outstanding choice for your home.</p>
<p>This Frigidaire unit quickly cools most rooms up to 550 square feet, which makes it an excellent option for many small homes or apartments. The maximum airflow rating is 200 CFM, and the air conditioner can remove up to three pints of water from the air per hour in Dry Mode. Although looked at separately the airflow, room-size rating and moisture collection are average for the industry, together they make the Frigidaire Gallery a strong contender.</p>

of the best portable air conditioners available.</p></blockquote>
<h4>Cons</h4>
<p>One feature that stands out is this unit&#8217;s oscillating louvers. None of the other portable AC units we reviewed have this feature. The oscillating louvers move up and down to circulate the air, helping to cool the room move up and down to circulate quickly and evenly.</p>

Despite its good performance, this portable air conditioner is one of the most efficient units we reviewed. With an energy efficiency ratio of we estimate its annual energy cost. In addition to efficiency, this unit is safe to run with a UL listing certifying the unit has passed important safety standards.</p>
<blockquote><p>This unit weighs 78 pounds, making it difficult for one<br />
person to carry it up and down stairs.</p></blockquote>
